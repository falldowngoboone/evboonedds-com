    <div class="o-flow">
      <p>Regularly scheduled dental maintenance aids in overall health as well as reduces the chance of major long-term damage
        and total dental costs. Dr. Boone's office offers routine oral examinations and cleanings to help keep your teeth
        healthy.
      </p>
      <p>Our comprehensive exam includes a complete oral examination and a full mouth series of 20 x-rays or a panoramic film
        and bite-wing x-rays used to screen for active decay and periodontal diseases. We will also discuss your dental history
        and any options you may need to maintain healthy teeth and gums or restore problem areas, as well as review any
        additional desires and/or concerns you may have.</p>
      <p>Having a hygienist perform thorough, routine cleanings is one of the best preventative measures you can take to
        maintain healthy teeth and gums. Our hygienists are licensed professionals who help evaluate problem areas and implement
        treatment plans based on patient needs.</p>
