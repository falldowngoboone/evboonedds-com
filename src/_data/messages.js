    message: `<p>To our loyal patients:</p>
<p>Our top priority is the health and wellbeing of our patients, families, staff, and community. To prevent the spread of COVID-19, Governor Greg Abbott signed an executive order postponing all elective dental procedures until midnight of April 21, 2020.</p>
<p>If you have a dental emergency, our office is open Monday through Thursday for morning appointments only. Patients will only be seen if there is an urgent need for treatment. Problems without pain should be scheduled when the COVID-19 situation is under control and the President and/or Governor allows dental offices to see patients without any restrictions.</p>
<p>For emergency or pain-related appointments, call our office at (409) 769-4433. When this is all over with, our office will work extremely hard to get all of our patients caught up with their dental needs. We appreciate your patience. God bless each and every one during this difficult time.</p>
<p>â€”Eugene V. Boone, D.D.S.</p>`,
